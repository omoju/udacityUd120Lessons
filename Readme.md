This repo contains the implemented mini-projects for the Intro to Artificial intelligence course on Udacity, taught by Sebastian Thrun and Katie Malone.

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

In addition, you will need to be able to run an jupyter Notebook to go along with this project.


## Run

In a terminal/command window, go to the top-level project directory `udacityUd120Lessons/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```jupyter notebook lessons/NAMEOFNOTEBOOK.ipynb```

## Data

The datasets used in this project are either available through [udacity/ud120-projects](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects) or scikit-learn built-in datasets.

## Note - Current Students
Even though it may be tempting to go through this repo and copy the code, I suggest you refrain from doing so until you have implemented your own mini-projects.
